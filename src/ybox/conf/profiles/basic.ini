# Configuration file for podman/docker containers used by ybox scripts.
# This is the common file included by all other configurations.
#
# Value format is as supported by python ConfigParser
# (e.g. https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html for Python3 docs).
# Specifically boolean values are extracted using getboolean() method which supports
# many different values like on/off, true/false etc.
# Key-value separator can only be '=' while ':' is not supported. Default basic value
# interpolation implemented by the python module has been extended to also support environment
# variables as described next.
#
# The values can contain environment variables using the notation supported by
# python expandvars (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.expandvars).
# A few special environment variables are also available:
#   - YBOX_DISTRIBUTION_NAME: name of the Linux distribution (as provided to 'ybox-create')
#   - YBOX_CONTAINER_NAME: name of the current container (as provided/set by 'ybox-create')
#   - YBOX_CONTAINER_DIR: set to $HOME/.local/share/ybox/$YBOX_CONTAINER_NAME for convenience
#   - YBOX_TARGET_SCRIPTS_DIR: local directory in the container where various ybox scripts
#                              are mounted (e.g. entrypoint scripts)
#   - YBOX_SYS_CONF_DIR: path to system configuration directory where configuration directory
#                        shipped with ybox is installed (or the string form of
#                          the directory if it is not on filesystem like an egg or similar)
#   - TARGET_HOME: set to the home directory of the container user in the container
#                  (which is same as the host user's $HOME for podman and /root for docker)
# Additionally a special notation can be used for current date+time with this notation:
#   ${NOW:<fmt>}. The <fmt> uses the format supported by python strftime
# (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strftime)
# while the NOW is the result of datetime.now() call.
#
# Expansion of other keys in the same section or the special 'DEFAULT' section is also provided
# using the notation supported by python's configparser BasicInterpolation, see:
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.BasicInterpolation
# In a nutshell you need '%(<var>)s' notation to expand <var> key and bare '%' should be '%%'.
# However, the '%' inside the ${NOW:<fmt>} format should not be escaped because all environment
# variables as well as ${NOW:...} are expanded before the variable references.
#
# NOTE: Take care to have different path settings point to distinct directory/path
# locations e.g. base.shared_root, base.home and base.log_opts.path (podman) should point to
# different directories else you can lose one or the other since the code currently does not
# check for such overlaps and will happily mount the directory as the container home while
# logs are also being written there which can result in an unpredictable behavior.
# Likewise the configuration files in [configs] section are temporarily copied/linked in
# $YBOX_CONTAINER_DIR/configs which is not configurable and should not be used and there
# is a temporary mount directory having utility scripts in $YBOX_CONTAINER_DIR/ybox-scripts

# Whether the system directories are shared between all containers of the same distribution
# is determined by this variable. The common system directories are bind mounted to a common
# host directory specified by this `shared_root` variable.
#
# It includes all directories (defined in distro.ini) that hold system package data which
# also means that the packages installed on one container are visible on all the containers
# of the same distribution. So those packages can be launched from any of the containers
# but they will be subject to that container configuration. The wrapper launcher scripts
# created by `ybox-pkg install` will ensure that packages are launched only from the containers
# where they were installed so that should be the preferred way to launch apps (except for
#   packages common to multiple containers which can be launched from any of those).

# These can be used to specify the configuration files from the host session
# that you want to share with the container. The files from the host session
# will either be copied or hard linked (depending on the "config_hardlinks" option in [base]
#   section) to a directory that is mounted read-only.
#
# The value has two parts separated by "->" with the LHS of this being the source that
# is to be copied while the RHS is the required relative path in the container's home directory.
# Any spaces around "->" are excluded from the LHS and RHS names.
# Source is skipped if it does not exist or not readable with a message on standard output.
#
# Typically this will contain shell, vim and other common configuration files.
# These can be either files or directories and are skipped if they do not exist.
# The keys here should be unique and can be used to override in later files that include this one.
#
# Two special suffixes can be used in the key names:
#  1) ":dir" : this suffix indicates that the source is a directory and entire directory structure
#              should be replicated in the target with symlinks only for the individual files;
#              this helps in cases where user needs to make a separate copy of a file inside
#              the directory (using either ":copy" suffix or manually)
#  2) ":copy": this suffix indicates that the source should be copied to the target; if a
#              file/directory to be copied lies inside another directory that is being linked,
#              then it should be mentioned before this and marked with ":dir" so that directory
#              structure is replicated in the target (see example of fish shell config below)
#
# Note: The files from the host are mounted read-only by default in the target container, so if
# you need to change a file within a container then you can use the ":copy" suffix in the key name
# or manually remove the symlink and make a copy of the file. This will remove the
# direct sharing between the two which has to be done manually thereon if required.
# The sharing behavior also depends on "config_hardlinks" as described in its comment above
# in the [base] section.
#
# Note: The LHS should typically have a path having $HOME while RHS will be relative to the
#       target's home inside the container. Do not use $TARGET_HOME on RHS since path the assumed
#       to be a relative one and $TARGET_HOME already inserted as required.
